"A consequence of Git's distributed nature is that history can be edited "
"easily. But if you tamper with the past, take care: only rewrite that part "
"of history which you alone possess. Just as nations forever argue over who "
"committed what atrocity, if someone else has a clone whose version of "
"history differs to yours, you will have trouble reconciling when your trees "
"interact."

"Some developers strongly feel history should be immutable, warts and all.  "
"Others feel trees should be made presentable before they are unleashed in "
"public. Git accommodates both viewpoints. Like cloning, branching, and "
"merging, rewriting history is simply another power Git gives you. It is up "
"to you to use it wisely."
